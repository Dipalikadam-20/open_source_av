# TASK 3: Paper Reading

## Action Items:
- Be part of one of these the group.
    - Group1: Lidar-Camera 
    - Group2: Radar-Camera
    - Group3: Lidar-Camera-Radar
- Find paper on each topics. Share it with the group so there are no conflicts.
- Follow [Tarun's example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0CSpxJMpQfcQ55jQGHQWEsWqWzX3jR_N69Lul2E9UI/edit?usp=sharing) and add details to the table he is preparing. 
- Be ready for next Saturday to discuss the details.
